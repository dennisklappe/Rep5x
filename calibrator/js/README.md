# JavaScript files

> **Developer note**: Apologies for the large JS files - I'm not a programmer but it works! Feel free to refactor and make a PR to improve the code quality.

## Files

- `landing.js` - Landing page logic
- `setup.js` - Setup and connection handling  
- `camera.js` - Camera interface logic
- `cone.js` - Cone interface logic
- `la-lb-camera.js` - Camera kinematic calibration
- `la-lb-cone.js` - Cone kinematic calibration
- `printer-interface.js` - Serial communication

## Structure notes

These files could definitely benefit from:
- Modularisation and separation of concerns
- Better error handling
- Code documentation
- Consistent naming conventions
- Modern ES6+ patterns

Contributions welcome to improve the code quality!
