# Rep5x - Printer models

Hardware designs and configurations for specific 3D printer models retrofitted with Rep5x 5-axis capability.

⚠️ **Pre-alpha**: Most configurations are still in development. For working prototypes, see individual model folders.

## Available models

### [Ender 5 Pro](ender-5-pro/)
- **Status**: Working prototype
- **Components**: Complete STL files, BOM, firmware configuration
- **Board**: BTT Octopus V1.1 with TMC2208 drivers
- **Features**: Continuous yaw rotation, >±90° tilt range

### [Ender 3 V3 SE](ender-3-v3-se/)
- **Status**: In development
- **Target board**: BTT Octopus Pro H723
- **Expected**: Future release

### [Generic](generic/)
- **Purpose**: General guidelines for adapting other printer models
- **Status**: Guidelines being developed
- **Use**: Starting point for custom retrofits

## Getting started

1. **Choose your base printer** from available models
2. **Review requirements** in the model's README and BOM
3. **Check firmware compatibility** in the firmware section
4. **Join Discord** for build support and discussions

## Contributing new models
