# Rep5x - Generic information

General information and guidelines for Rep5x 5-axis printing retrofits across different printer models.

⚠️ **Early development**: Generic guidelines are still being developed based on prototype testing. For proven configurations, see specific printer models like [Ender 5 Pro](../ender-5-pro/).

## Common requirements

### Electronics
- **Control board**: Board with 6+ stepper drivers
- **Stepper drivers**: TMC drivers recommended (UART or SPI)
- **Additional motors**: 2x NEMA17 steppers for yaw/tilt axes
- **Slip ring**: Multi-channel for continuous rotation (12+ channels recommended)
- **Power supply**: Adequate capacity for additional motors

### Firmware
- **Marlin 2.1.x**: Currently supported firmware
- **Axes configuration**: I and J axes for yaw/tilt rotation

### Mechanical
- **Rotation capability**: Yaw (continuous 360°) and Tilt (>±90°)
- **Bearings**: Standard ball bearings for rotation axes
- **Belt drive**: GT2 timing belts typically used
- **Frame compatibility**: Adequate space for rotating assembly

## Adaptation guidelines

### For new printer models
1. **Assess frame compatibility** - Space for rotating assembly
2. **Electronics integration** - Mount location for control board
3. **Mechanical interface** - X-carriage modification requirements
4. **Wiring routing** - Path for additional cables

### Design considerations
- **Print volume impact** - Rotating assembly reduces build area
- **Weight distribution** - Additional motors affect dynamics

## Status

⚠️ **In development**: Generic guidelines are being refined based on prototype testing and community feedback.
