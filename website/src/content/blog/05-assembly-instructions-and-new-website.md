I'm excited to share two updates for the Rep5x project: **assembly instructions are now available**, and we have a new website to make the project more accessible!

## Making 5-axis accessible to everyone

GitHub remains the heart of the development, all the files, documentation, and collaboration happen there. But after chatting with some people I realised that navigating GitHub can be intimidating if you're not familiar with it. That's why I created [Rep5x.com](https://rep5x.com) - a friendly front door to the project that won't scare away makers who might be put off by repository structures and markdown instructions.

The website offers:
- An introduction to what Rep5x is and can do
- The GitHub build guides with visual instructions
- Direct links to all the resources in our GitHub repository
- A less technical entry point for those new to open-source projects
- The same information, just presented in a more familiar web format

## Assembly instructions: ready for builders

After some refining of the build process, I've documented the main steps needed to convert a standard 3D printer into a 5-axis machine. The instructions are now available and tested on real builds.

The guide covers:
- **Electronics preparation** - Control board setup, firmware flashing, and wiring
- **Component assembly** - With photos of each step
- **Printer installation** - Mounting the 5-axis system to your existing printer

## Let's build together

**I'm looking for makers who want to build a 5-axis printer - I'd love to see your take on it and collaborate to improve the project together.** Your build experience will help identify gaps in documentation, pain points in the process, and areas that need refinement.

If you're interested in building a 5-axis printer, we can collaborate directly: I'll help with parts sourcing and printer compatibility questions, we'll troubleshoot challenges and document solutions, I'll assist with firmware configuration for your specific setup, together we'll work through calibration and first prints, and your feedback will help adapt the design and instructions.

This collaboration benefits everyone, your build helps improve Rep5x for the entire community while you get a working 5-axis printer.

## Ready to start?

The complete assembly instructions are available on our [build instructions page](/build-instructions/) and in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dennisklappe/Rep5x/blob/main/build-guide/assembly-instructions-universal.md), with universal instructions plus guides for specific printer models.

If you're interested in building a 5-axis printer or have questions, **[join our Discord](https://discord.gg/GNdah82VBg)** - the fastest way to reach me and other builders.

If you're an experienced maker with some 3D printing modification experience, I'd love to see your take on building a 5-axis printer. The website might make it easier to get started, and we can collaborate through the build process.

Let's expand what's possible with desktop 3D printing!
