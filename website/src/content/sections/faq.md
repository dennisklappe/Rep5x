# FAQ List
list:
  - title: What is Rep5x and how does it work?
    description: Rep5x is an open-source retrofit system that adds 5-axis capability to existing 3D printers. It uses two additional rotational axes (yaw and pitch) in the print head to enable printing complex geometries without supports and achieve better surface quality.
    active: true
  - title: Which printers are compatible with Rep5x?
    description: Rep5x currently supports the Ender 5 Pro and Ender 3 V3 SE with working prototypes. The project uses a modular design approach to support additional printer platforms through community contributions.
  - title: Do I need special firmware or software?
    description: Yes, Rep5x requires firmware modifications to handle the additional axes and inverse kinematics calculations. We provide modified Marlin firmware and configuration.
  - title: How difficult is it to build a Rep5x system?
    description: The build requires intermediate 3D printing and electronics knowledge. Most retrofit parts can be printed on your existing 3D printer. The project is currently in beta stage with documentation available. Community support is available through our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/75Hy5dMwTJ).
  - title: What are the benefits of 5-axis printing?
    description: 5-axis printing eliminates the need for support structures in most cases, reduces material waste, improves surface finish quality, and enables printing of complex geometries that are impossible with traditional 3-axis methods.
  - title: Is Rep5x completely free and open source?
    description: Yes, all Rep5x hardware designs, firmware, and documentation are released under the GPL v3 License. You can build, modify, and contribute to Rep5x systems. The only costs are for components and materials needed for assembly.
