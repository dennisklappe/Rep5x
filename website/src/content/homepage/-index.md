  content: "A retrofit system that adds yaw and pitch rotation to existing 3D printers, letting you print complex shapes without support material."
  badge: "Technical Overview"
  cards:
    - title: "Retrofit Design"
      content: "Adds yaw and pitch rotation axes to existing 3D printers with continuous yaw rotation and >90° pitch tilt range."
      icon: "lucide:settings"
    - title: "Reduced Support Requirements"
      content: "Yaw and pitch rotation allow printing complex geometries support-free, eliminating support structures for many overhangs."
      icon: "lucide:layers-3"
    - title: "Better Part Strength"
      content: "Control over layer orientation allows for stronger parts by aligning print layers with load directions and stress patterns."

    - title: "Material Efficiency"
      content: "Reduced support material usage decreases waste and post-processing time for suitable part geometries."
