#### Project Usage

Rep5x is an open-source research project distributed under the GPL v3 License. You are free to use, modify, and distribute the project materials, but any derivative works must also be distributed under GPL v3. This ensures that improvements remain open and accessible to the community.

All hardware designs, firmware, and documentation are provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. Users are responsible for ensuring safe operation of any 3D printer modifications.

#### Community Guidelines

When participating in Rep5x community spaces (Discord, GitHub, forums):

1. Be respectful and constructive in all interactions
2. Share knowledge and help others learn
3. Report safety issues or design flaws promptly
4. Give credit to contributors when sharing modifications

#### Intellectual Property

All original contributions to Rep5x become part of the open-source project under the same GPL v3 License. Contributors retain copyright to their work while granting usage rights to the community under GPL v3 terms.

If you submit modifications or improvements, you confirm you have the right to license that work under GPL v3 terms. This ensures that all improvements remain freely available to the community.

#### Research and Academic Use

This project is part of ongoing academic research at the University of Twente, building upon research by Janis Andersons. The goal is to democratise 5-axis 3D printing through affordable retrofit systems for consumer printers.

Research data may be collected from community interactions and build reports for analysis. All data collection follows university ethics guidelines and GDPR requirements.

#### Liability and Safety

Users are responsible for:
- Safe operation of modified 3D printers
- Compliance with local regulations
- Proper electrical and mechanical assembly
- Risk assessment of their specific setup

The project maintainers are not liable for any damage, injury, or loss resulting from use of Rep5x designs or modifications.

#### Updates

These terms may be updated as the project evolves. Significant changes will be announced through project communication channels.
