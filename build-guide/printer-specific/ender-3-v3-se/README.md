# Rep5x - Ender 3 V3 SE

The Ender 3 V3 SE requires several modifications compared to other printers: you'll need to add new endstop mounts for X and Z axes (the stock CR Touch and print head endstop won't work), replace or modify the hotend to support Bowden tube retention (stock is direct drive only), switch to an external Bowden extruder, and use a compatible display like the BTT Mini 12864 or run headless (the stock screen doesn't work with Marlin). See the printer-specific BOM and assembly instructions below for details.
