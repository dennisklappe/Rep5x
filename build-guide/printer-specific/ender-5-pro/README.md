# Rep5x - Ender 5 Pro adaptation

Follow the main [assembly instructions](../../assembly-instructions-universal.md) with these Ender 5 Pro specific differences.

## What's different

The Ender 5 Pro adaptation is a simple conversion, requiring only a longer Bowden tube compared to the universal build. The printer's existing CoreXY kinematics and standard electronics make it compatible with the Rep5x system without requiring additional modifications to endstops, hotend, or display components that other printer models need. You may need to extend certain JST cables depending on your control board placement.
