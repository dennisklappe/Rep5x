## What's different

### Compatibility: ✅ Tested
- **Spacious electronics enclosure** - Fits BTT Octopus V1.1 easily
- **Rigid cube frame** - Ideal for 5-axis stability
- **Linear rail X-carriage** - Perfect mounting points available

### Printer-specific parts needed
- **[carriage-mount.3mf](carriage-mount.3mf)** - Mounts to existing M4 holes
- **4x M4x8mm bolts** - For carriage mount installation
